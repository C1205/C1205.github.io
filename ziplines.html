    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>So straight out of the movies, ziplines are super cool. Also, its a very fast mode of transport and the scenery when doing it can be breathtaking. But <strong>Nobody</strong> talks about it <em>scientifically</em>. So how does it work and what are its uses?</p>

    <h3>Its uses:</h3>
    <p>So it all started long ago when people used it travel across gaps, but now most of them have been replaced by bridges as they are much safer. Now, we mainly use it at chidren adventure playgrounds, camp obstacle courses and canopy tours. Still, its cool zipping down a zipline like James Bond. (<span style="font-style: oblique">Well, not really like James Bond</span>)</p>

    <div class="how">
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>There is a groove wheel on a zipline called a sheave, and the pulley turns as it travels along thus reducing friction so you can go zoom zoom. And of course, the zipline is steep to allow gravity to pull the user down.</p>

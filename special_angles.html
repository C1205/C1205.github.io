    <h3 class="intro">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="intro">Sooo you probably know at least 1 of these. But its not common that a person knows all of these. Plus, they only teach you acute, right and <del>obese</del> <ins>obtuse</ins> angles.(And thats not even half of all types of angles.) So what do all these angles mean?</p>

    <h3 class="complete">Complete and reflex angles</h3>
    <p class="complete">Even if you never heard of these angles, they are pretty straightforward. Basically, a complete angle is a 360 degrees angle (Sorry, I can't type degree symbol lol.) and a reflex angle is an angle from 180 degrees and 360 degrees.But since a protractor has only up till 180 degrees, you need to find out the other angle first and the minus from the complete angle. (think of it as a circle that has 2 angles.)</p>

    <h3 class="straight">Straight and zero angles</h3>
    <p class="straight">These angles are super easy to understand. Basically, a straight angle is 180 degrees and a zero angle is 0 degrees (you can tell by the name.) and they can be both be seen on a straight line. But they are formed differently. A straight angle is 2 lines open up until it reaches 180 degrees while a zero angle is an angle squeezed into 0 degrees.</p>

    <h3 class="inverted">Extra: Inverting lines</h3>
    <p class="inverted">I'm pretty sure you heard of perpendicular and parellel lines but inverting lines are different. They are just lines that invert or cross with each other. It forms a "V" and is the size of an acute angle. They are betwwen perpendicular and parellel lines. They can also cross over each other.</p>

    <p class="table">Here's a table of all the angles</p>
    <table border="8">

    <!--Intro-->
    <h3 class="intro-a">Introduction (part 1):</h3>
    <p class="intro-a">Hi! This is my <em>first</em> project that is going to be shared on <mark>Github!</mark> So I put <strong>a lot of effort</strong> into this. I hope you like it! </p>

    <h3 class="intro-b">Introduction (part 2):</h3>
    <p class="intro-b">Sooo, about the series. It is where I explain things that people rarely talk about. And its of course not going to be about your stuffed toys or anything like that. Its about sciency things that I have picked. And this page is targeted for all people. Anyone can read it!:D There will be 4 pages(including this).However, I will be adding one more in the future.</p>

    <h3 class="why">So<em>oooooo</em> why this series?</h3>
    <p class="why">At first, I thought about talking about my coding journey, but I scratched the plan because I did not really have ideas for it. Then, I watched a show called "Explained" on Netflix (here's the link to watch: <a id="explained" href="https://www.netflix.com/sg/title/80216752" target="_blank">Explained</a>) and got the idea that instead of explaining common things we are all worrying about, why not about rare things? I do'nt think anyone has ever done this.(Well, at least I think so.) So let's start <strong>now!</strong></p>
